\section{Problem definition}
\textbf{How many people are in the office?}\\

\textit{"Use iBeacons to determine the amount of people currently in the office. Aggregate the data to apply machine learning and data visualizations.
Using iBeacons we would like to make an app that registers whenever the user enters or leaves our office. We would like to aggregate that data to use for cool data visualizations and applying machine learning to the data to obtain knowledge about the general usage patterns of the office. This could e.g. be used to adjust the heating, automatically lock the doors and turn off the lights when the last person leaves, predict when we need to order more or less lunch, or simply to check whether a certain person is currently at the office."} $^[$\footnote{www.shape.dk/projects}$^]$\\

\textbf{In the following description, explain when the term account is used as an application domain concept and when as a solution domain concept:}\\
"...managing bank accounts for mobile costumers." - It is used as an application domain concept, saying what it is supposed to do. 
"...provide access to the accounts when the..." - It is used the same way as before. 
"One proposal is that accounts are made available on the mobile computer..." - Here it is used as a solution domain concept, as it is a possible solution to be evaluated. 
"...the accounts show the amounts from the last connected session." - It is used in connection with the previous use.\\
